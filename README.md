Implementation of various algorithms that train an agent to behave properly
in the [CartPole](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0) OpenAI
[Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment, the last being policy gradient.
The implementation is done w/ [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
